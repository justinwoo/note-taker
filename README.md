# Note taker

I want to draw notes using SVG and be able to compose really simple sheet music (and also be able to load data to display things I've jotted down).

WIP (reach out to me if you know how to do this or have ideas you'd like to share)


# Development

`npm install`
`open index.html`
`make watch`


# TODO

add testing tool
model data
actual research
